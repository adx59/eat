# Notes/Bugs
Please note that once you stamp on fire, it will go out. IT'S NOT A BUG, IT'S A FEATURE

Sometimes, the game and display will load, but your controls will fail to work. I don't know if something is wrong with my code, or if it is Processing itself.

Some parts of this game make use of Processing 3's new features, so it may not work on Processing 2.
